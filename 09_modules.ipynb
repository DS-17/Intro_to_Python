All of them will excecute and import the entire namespace of the target, even when it doesn't seem like it. The names are there, in memory no matter which style you choose - but they may or may not be injected into your namespace. This choice is not about memory, it's about namespace clutter. The following example is prefered because it causes the least namespace clutter."

While this example doesn't have the problems of the next example, it still has issues. For one, everything you import like this will be added to the top level of your namespace. At small scale this is not a problem, but it can become a problem if you have many imports in a large project.\n",

However, if later you want to use some other part of the module you have to scroll up add that to the import statement, then scroll back down to your code. Small project - no big deal, large project - major pain. Some IDEs can handle imports for you, and this can give you the best of all worlds."

Worse case: we can no longer be sure that we're not creating name conflicts. Don't use star imports in production code. It's fine if it's the only import in a single module, but it's still bad form."
