Python2 may be required by your operating system. In addition, it is not recommended to modify, update or extend your system's Python2 library in any way. Your system can take care of that itself, and it is dangeous to do so yourself. Another option to avoid this problem is to develop Python in a virtual environment. As with most things, there are many strategies - with pros and cons for each."

The expression `str(42)` should produce the string \"42\" from the int 42, but it can't now that the name `str` was overwritten. This general idea is true for all built-in names at the global scope.
